API Playground is a Data Science exploration app developed using the [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) library. The idea is to develop my skills in the Data Science world. This app explores real-world data from public APIs and basically the idea is to build many different dashboards that you can checkout in the sidebar on the left.
